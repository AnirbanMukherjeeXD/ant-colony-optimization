# Ant Colony Optimization
This project solves the [Shortest Path Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem) using [Ant Colony Optimization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms).

## Usage
### Launching
- Download the entire project 
- Extract the files
- Open the index.html file

OR <br> [Open this link](https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/AnirbanMukherjeeXD/ant-colony-optimization/38651a11/index.html)
### Setup
- Create Nodes by clicking on the canvas *[The first node is the source node]*
- Enter Weights between each nodes 
- Set the following parameters :
  - Destination Node *(by default 1)* 
  - Number of Ants *(by default 10)* 
  - Pheromone Rate *(by default 50)* 
  - Evaporation Rate *(by default 20%)*
### Algorithm
- To run the algorithm continuously, click *Run Algorithm*
- To run the algorithm one iteration at a time, click *Step by step*
### Result
The path with the most prominent shade of red is the shortest path
### Modify parameters
You can modify the *Pheromone Rate* and *Evaporation Rate* parameters while the algorithm is running to see the corresponding changes on the canvas
